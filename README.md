## Project Description

In this project, I focus on harnessing the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Smart Health applications. my primary objective is to develop innovative machine-learning models that optimize healthcare processes, enable early diagnostics, and personalize patient care. I explore various AI algorithms, deep learning techniques, and data analysis methodologies to achieve my research goals.

## Dataset

For my research, I use the "heart_disease.csv" dataset, which includes various medical features and the binary target variable indicating the presence of heart disease. (Please note that this is a hypothetical dataset for demonstration purposes.)

### Dataset Description

- age: Age of the patient.
- sex: Gender (0: Female, 1: Male).
- cp: Chest pain type (1: Typical angina, 2: Atypical angina, 3: Non-anginal pain, 4: Asymptomatic).
- trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg).
- chol: Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dL).
- fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL (1: True, 0: False).
- restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0: Normal, 1: Abnormal, 2: Probable ventricular hypertrophy).
- thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.
- exang: Exercise induced angina (1: Yes, 0: No).
- oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1: Upsloping, 2: Flat, 3: Downsloping).
- ca: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.
- thal: Thalassemia (3: Normal, 6: Fixed defect, 7: Reversible defect).
- target: 0 (No heart disease) or 1 (Heart disease).

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Before running the code, ensure you have the "heart_disease.csv" dataset in the project directory.

Execute the main Python script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Model Training
My machine learning models are implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The neural network architecture consists of several hidden layers with activation functions and dropout regularization.

For model training details and hyperparameter tuning, refer to the "model_training.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook.

Evaluation
I evaluate the model's performance using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

For evaluation details and result analysis, refer to the "evaluation.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook.

Results and Interpretations
My research findings and interpretations can be found in the "results_and_interpretations.pdf" document.
